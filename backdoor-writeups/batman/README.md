Description:
------------

Extract a flag from Batman's website.

Solution:
---------

Click the links on the left to move around the site. It doesn't do anything interesting. The **Flag** link just takes you to a page with an unhelpful message:

> We don't give flag to outsiders. We are Batman

But you should notice that the pages all have very similar addresses such as `/?st=1`, `/?st=2`, `/?st=3` and so on. The last link in the menu is `/?st=8`. But perhaps there are more pages in the site besides the ones in this menu? See what you can find...
