Description:
------------

Retrieve a flag from a website that no longer exists.

Solution:
---------

The link points here: http://fristonio.me/flag.html

But there's a problem. There's no website there, and the fristonio.me domain has expired. How can you examine the contents of a web page that no longer exists? Is there perhaps some sort of Machine that you can use to look Way Back into the history of the Internet?
