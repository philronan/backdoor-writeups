Description:
------------

Extract a flag from a website. Plus some kind of story about robots.

Solution:
---------

The link takes you to a page that doesn't say much:

> Sorry you're at the wrong place. You'll get nothing here. Go back.

Taking a cue from the title of this challenge, let's see if there is perhaps a `robots.txt` file. Change `index.html` to `robots.txt` in the address bar. Now you can probably see why this challenge is only worth 20 points.
