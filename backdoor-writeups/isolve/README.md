Description:
------------

Solve a jigsaw to obtain a flag.

Solution:
---------

The puzzle pieces are all 100×100 pixel square images, some white-on-black, some black-on-white. You could probably write a clever program to match these together, but I just chucked them all into the same page of an image editor and shuffled them around until they fit.

It's quite easy to get sixteen separate letters in this way, but now you need to get them in the right order. I'm sure you'll figure out what to do⢀⡀⣀
